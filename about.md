The dataset in this shiny application was obtained from the Kaggle, data collection site 
<https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/version/2>.

The purpose of this shiny application is to use basic machine learning approaches in order to classify breast tumors as either benign or malignant. Three approaches were applies which are: `naiveBayes` function for Naive Bayes algorithm from the R package `e1071`, `C5.0` function for Decision Trees algorithm from the R package `C50`, and `knn` function for k-nearest neighbors algorithm from the R package `class`. The results are plotted and summarized.
